## ▶️ How to Run

Run the main calculator program using Python:

```bash
python calculator.py
```

You will enter into an **interactive input mode** where you can type expressions like:

```
sin(45)
log(100, 10)
5! + 4^2
sqrt(64)
```

## 📘 Example Operations

| Operation    | Example Input  | Output |
| ------------ | -------------- | ------ |
| Addition     | `5 + 3`        | `8`    |
| Trigonometry | `sin(30)`      | `0.5`  |
| Logarithm    | `log(100, 10)` | `2`    |
| Factorial    | `factorial(5)` | `120`  |
| Square Root  | `sqrt(144)`    | `12`   |

---

## ⚙️ Supported Mathematical Functions

* `sin(x)`, `cos(x)`, `tan(x)`
* `log(x, base)`
* `sqrt(x)`
* `exp(x)`
* `factorial(n)`
* `pow(x, y)` or `x ** y`
* Parentheses and operator precedence

## 🛠 Customization

This calculator is modular—add more functions easily:

```python
def new_function(x):
    return x ** 3 + 2
```

Then register it in the function map.
